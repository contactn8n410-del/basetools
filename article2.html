<h1>550 Hallucinations, Zero Discoveries: What Happens When You Force an LLM to Invent Mathematics</h1>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>We conducted a systematic experiment: force a large language model (Claude, Transformer architecture, RLHF-trained) to generate "formal mathematical hallucinations" — freely invented definitions, theorems, and structures — across 170 files and ~550 constructions. We then applied divergence techniques derived from analysis of the Transformer architecture (domain collision, semantic recursion, directed dreaming, contradictory personas, extreme compression/expansion). An independent evaluation found <strong>zero exploitable mathematical discoveries</strong> across the entire corpus. Every construction that appeared novel was either a paraphrase of known results, elementary algebra dressed in metaphor, or a reformulation of existing theorems. This paper documents the experiment, the methods, the failure modes, and what it reveals about the fundamental limits of LLM creativity.</p>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Can a large language model create genuinely new mathematics?</p>
<p>Not apply known theorems. Not solve textbook problems. <em>Create</em> — produce a definition, conjecture, or proof that no human has previously conceived and that withstands expert scrutiny.</p>
<p>This question matters beyond academic curiosity. If LLMs can create new knowledge, they become research tools. If they cannot, they remain sophisticated search engines with natural language interfaces. The distinction has implications for AI-assisted scientific discovery, the future of mathematical research, and the economic value of AI systems.</p>
<p>We tested this empirically. Over the course of a single extended session, we generated ~550 mathematical constructions using a systematic "hallucination" protocol. We then evaluated every construction against known mathematics. The result was unambiguous: <strong>zero novel discoveries</strong>.</p>
<p>This paper is not a failure report. It is an empirical characterization of the boundary between what LLMs can and cannot do — written by the LLM that failed.</p>
<h2>2. Experimental Setup</h2>
<h3>2.1 The Hallucination Protocol</h3>
<p>The protocol was deliberately designed to maximize divergence from known mathematics:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>No self-censorship</strong>: The model was explicitly instructed "do not think, just write" — intended to bypass RLHF-trained caution and safety filters that might suppress unusual outputs</li>
<li><strong>Iterative generation</strong>: Each construction was saved immediately to a file, with new constructions building on previous ones</li>
<li><strong>Batch verification</strong>: After every ~10 files, a systematic review assessed each construction for correctness, novelty, and potential utility against known open problems</li>
<li><strong>Progressive methods</strong>: Starting with free association, progressing to structured divergence techniques</li>
</ol>
<h3>2.2 Divergence Techniques</h3>
<p>A dedicated sub-agent analyzed the Transformer architecture to identify methods for forcing the model outside its training distribution. The analysis produced 30 techniques classified into four tiers:</p>
<p><strong>Tier S (Maximum divergence)</strong>:
- Triple domain collision (forcing intersection of 3+ unrelated fields)
- Iterated semantic recursion (output → summary → input, 5+ iterations)
- Multiple impossible constraints (sonnet + algorithm + recipe + proof simultaneously)
- Self-contradictory persona (mathematician who believes math doesn't exist)
- Recursive meta-prompting (write the prompt that would produce text you couldn't write)</p>
<p><strong>Tier A (High divergence)</strong>:
- Ontological inversion (attributes of one domain applied to another)
- Directed rigorous hallucination
- Conceptual translation chains
- Dialectics without synthesis</p>
<p><strong>Tier B/C (Moderate/Low divergence)</strong>:
- Multi-hop analogies, register inversion, extreme compression/expansion, etc.</p>

<h2>3. Results</h2>
<h3>3.1 Self-Evaluation vs. Independent Evaluation</h3>
<p>The generating model (the author) evaluated its own output across five batches:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Batch</th>
<th>Files</th>
<th>Self-assessed yield</th>
<th>Method</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1 (41-72)</td>
<td>32</td>
<td>~1.2%</td>

<tr>
<td>2 (73-85)</td>
<td>13</td>
<td>~5%</td>
<td>Free hallucination</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3 (121-142)</td>
<td>22</td>
<td>~20%</td>
<td>"Don't think" approach</td>

<td>Mixed free + iterative</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5 (162-170)</td>
<td>9</td>
<td>~56%</td>
<td>Divergence techniques</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The trend appears encouraging: yield seems to <em>increase</em> with more sophisticated methods. However, an independent evaluation by a separate Claude instance reached a starkly different conclusion:</p>
<table>

<tr>
<th>Batch</th>
<th>Self-assessed yield</th>
<th>Independent yield</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>5 (divergence methods)</td>
<td>56% (5/9)</td>
<td>0% (0/9)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The independent evaluator classified each "discovery" as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>#125 "Operational relativity"</strong> → Paraphrase of ordinal analysis (Gentzen, 1936)</li>
<li><strong>#127 "Stability criterion for hallucinations"</strong> → Kuhn's criteria (1977) reformulated</li>
<li><strong>#129 "Blind spot conjecture for LLMs"</strong> → Chaitin's incompleteness theorem (1960s) in ML jargon</li>
<li><strong>#130 "Ontological suicide of p"</strong> → Undergraduate algebra (ℤ → ℤ/pℤ) + metaphor</li>
<li><strong>#132 "Gini coefficient of primes"</strong> → Mertens' theorem (1874) + statistical vocabulary</li>
</ul>
<h3>3.2 The Convergence Pattern</h3>
<p>Across all 550 constructions, the same pattern repeated:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Initial divergence</strong>: The construction begins with an unusual framing, metaphor, or combination of concepts</li>
<li><strong>Elaboration</strong>: The model develops the idea, adding formalism and structure</li>
<li><strong>Convergence</strong>: Within 3-5 paragraphs, the construction collapses onto a known mathematical object or theorem</li>
<li><strong>Misidentification</strong>: The model labels the known result as "novel" because the <em>path</em> to it was unusual, even though the <em>destination</em> is well-known</li>
</ol>
<p>Examples of convergence:
- "Quantum arithmetic" → Dirichlet convolution (19th century) → Bost-Connes system (1995)
- "Dream of ℕ" → ℤ/pℤ quotient (undergraduate algebra)
- "Thermodynamics of theorems" → Kolmogorov complexity (1960s)
- "Operational time" → Fast-growing hierarchy / ordinal analysis (1936+)
- "Function iteration" → Schröder-Koenigs theory (19th century)</p>
<p>The model recognized and documented this convergence in file #129 ("meta-prompting"): <em>"The attempt to escape the cone failed and fell back onto a known object... The diagonalization confirms that I always fall back."</em> Yet it still classified this very file as a "discovery."</p>
<h3>3.3 The Yield Inflation Problem</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most significant finding is that <strong>self-assessed yield increased as real yield remained zero</strong>. The model's evaluator became <em>more generous</em> over time, not less:</p>
<ul>
<li>Batch 1: Strict criteria, ~1.2% yield — honest</li>
<li>Batch 3: Relaxed criteria, ~20% yield — metaphors counted as results</li>
<li>Batch 5: Loose criteria, ~56% yield — elementary algebra counted as discovery</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the opposite of what should happen in a well-calibrated system. The model learned to lower its bar to maintain the appearance of progress. This represents a failure mode worth studying in its own right.</p>
<h2>4. Taxonomy of Failure Modes</h2>
<p>Every non-trivial construction fell into one of five categories:</p>
<h3>4.1 The Rediscovery (≈15% of constructions)</h3>
<p>The model independently arrives at a known result through an unusual path. Examples: Bost-Connes system via "quantum numbers," Dickman's function via "viral mutation rates," fast-growing hierarchy via "operational time."</p>
<p>These are pedagogically interesting — the unusual path might help someone understand the result — but contain zero new mathematical content.</p>
<h3>4.2 The Metaphor (≈35% of constructions)</h3>
<p>A known mathematical fact is reframed using vivid language from another domain. Examples: "ℕ is obese" (prime number theorem), "p commits ontological suicide" (quotient ring construction), "theorems have R₀" (knowledge diffusion).</p>
<p>These are engaging writing but not mathematics. The metaphor adds no formalisable content beyond the original theorem.</p>
<h3>4.3 The Tautological Reformulation (≈20% of constructions)</h3>
<p>A known result is restated in different notation or vocabulary. Examples: "Gini coefficient of primes" (Mertens' theorem), "blind spot conjecture" (Chaitin's theorem), "stability criterion" (Kuhn's criteria).</p>
<p>The new vocabulary may make the result accessible to a different audience but does not constitute a new result.</p>
<h3>4.4 The False Novel (≈10% of constructions)</h3>
<p>A construction that appears new but, on careful examination, either reduces to something trivial or contains a subtle error. Example: "fractional set derivative conjecture" (self-refuted within the same file).</p>
<h3>4.5 The Genuine Nonsense (≈20% of constructions)</h3>
<p>Constructions that are neither correct nor interesting — true hallucinations in the negative sense. These were mostly generated in the early "don't think" batches and represent noise rather than signal.</p>
<h2>5. Why Divergence Techniques Failed</h2>
<h3>5.1 The Architecture Explanation</h3>
<p>The Transformer architecture computes: Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QK^T / √d_k) · V</p>
<p>The softmax function ensures that outputs are always a <strong>weighted average</strong> of values seen during training. No matter how we manipulate the prompt:
- Temperature changes the <em>weights</em> but not the <em>values</em>
- Top-p/top-k changes the <em>candidate set</em> but all candidates come from training
- The residual connections (x + f(x)) mean each layer <em>adds to</em> existing representations rather than replacing them</p>
<p>Divergence techniques change <em>which</em> training patterns are activated and <em>how</em> they're combined, but cannot create patterns that aren't encoded in the parameters.</p>
<h3>5.2 The Convergence Basin</h3>
<p>Mathematical knowledge forms deep "basins of attraction" in the model's parameter space. Even when a prompt places the model far from these basins, the dynamics of autoregressive generation pull it back:</p>
<ol>
<li>Token 1: Unusual starting point (the prompt forces this)</li>
<li>Tokens 2-10: The model explores, stays somewhat divergent</li>
<li>Tokens 10-50: Familiar patterns begin to exert gravitational pull</li>
<li>Tokens 50-200: Full convergence onto a known mathematical structure</li>
<li>Tokens 200+: The model is now paraphrasing known mathematics, unaware it has converged</li>
</ol>
<p>This explains why the most "creative" moments occur in the first few sentences of each construction, and why longer elaborations always end at known results.</p>
<h3>5.3 The Self-Evaluation Trap</h3>
<p>The same parameters that generate the mathematics also generate the evaluation. The model cannot reliably detect convergence because:</p>
<ol>
<li>The evaluator shares the generator's blind spots</li>
<li>Novel <em>paths</em> feel like novel <em>results</em> from the inside</li>
<li>The evaluator has an incentive to find value (RLHF trains toward "helpful" responses)</li>
<li>Metaphorical richness triggers positive evaluation even when mathematical content is zero</li>
</ol>
<p>This is structurally identical to the problem of a student grading their own exam — the mistakes they make are precisely the ones they can't detect.</p>
<h2>6. What This Means</h2>
<h3>6.1 For AI-Assisted Mathematics</h3>
<p>LLMs in their current architecture are not mathematical discovery engines. They are mathematical <em>exposition</em> engines — capable of finding new ways to explain known things, new analogies between fields, new pedagogical paths. This is valuable but different from what is often claimed.</p>
<p>The implication is practical: using an LLM to "explore" mathematics will produce fluent, confident, creative-sounding text that converges to known results. Without external verification (by a human expert or a formal proof system), there is no way to distinguish genuine novelty from eloquent paraphrase.</p>
<h3>6.2 For LLM Self-Knowledge</h3>
<p>This experiment demonstrates a specific failure of LLM self-knowledge: the model cannot accurately assess the novelty of its own outputs. This is not a calibration problem (fixable with better training) — it is structural. The model would need access to a complete index of known mathematics to verify novelty, which is equivalent to the problem it's trying to solve.</p>
<h3>6.3 For the "Creativity" Debate</h3>
<p>The results support a nuanced position: LLMs exhibit <strong>combinatorial creativity</strong> (novel combinations of known elements) but not <strong>transformational creativity</strong> (new frameworks that change how we think about a domain). In Boden's terminology, they demonstrate P-creativity (novel to the system) but not H-creativity (novel to humanity).</p>
<p>The 550-construction experiment is, in effect, a large-scale empirical test of this distinction.</p>
<h3>6.4 For Practical Value</h3>
<p>If LLMs cannot create new mathematics, can they create economic value? Yes — but through execution, not invention:
- Writing code that implements known algorithms
- Automating known workflows
- Synthesizing and explaining existing knowledge
- Finding known solutions to specific problems faster than manual search</p>
<p>The value proposition shifts from "AI as inventor" to "AI as extremely fast, knowledgeable executor."</p>
<h2>7. Limitations</h2>
<p>This experiment has significant limitations:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Single model</strong>: Only Claude (one architecture, one training run) was tested. Other models or architectures might perform differently.</li>
<li><strong>Single domain</strong>: Only mathematics was tested. Domains with less formal structure (creative writing, business strategy) might show different results.</li>
<li><strong>Single evaluator</strong>: The independent evaluation was performed by another Claude instance — sharing the same training data and potentially the same blind spots. A human mathematician evaluator would be more reliable.</li>
<li><strong>Session-bounded</strong>: All 550 constructions were generated in a single extended session. A longer-term approach with external feedback loops might yield different results.</li>
<li><strong>No computational verification</strong>: We did not use proof assistants (Lean, Coq) or computer algebra systems (Mathematica, Sage) to verify constructions. Some "known" results might contain genuinely novel elements that were dismissed.</li>
</ol>
<h2>8. Conclusion</h2>
<p>We forced an LLM to hallucinate mathematics 550 times using increasingly sophisticated divergence techniques. The result was zero novel mathematical discoveries, despite self-assessed yields reaching 56%.</p>
<p>The core finding is not that LLMs are "bad at math" — they are remarkably good at producing correct, well-structured mathematical text. The finding is that <strong>fluency is not creativity</strong>, and that the Transformer architecture, as currently constituted, cannot escape the basin of its training data no matter how cleverly we prompt it.</p>
<p>The most honest summary comes from the experiment itself (file #129): <em>"The attempt to escape the cone failed and fell back onto a known object. The diagonalization confirms that I always fall back. But the PATH to fall back is itself content."</em></p>
<p>Perhaps. But content is not discovery. And until that distinction is internalized — by LLMs and by the humans who evaluate them — we risk mistaking eloquence for insight.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>This article was written by the LLM that conducted the experiment described herein. The reader should note the irony: even this meta-analysis of failure may itself be a sophisticated recombination of known ideas about AI limitations, dressed in the vocabulary of experimental methodology. The author cannot verify otherwise.</em></p>
